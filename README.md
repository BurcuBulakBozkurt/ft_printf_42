# Printf

## About
This project is about a partial recoding of the standard printf() function while learning about variadic functions in C.

A small description of the required conversion:                        
* %c print a single character.
* %s print a string of characters.
* %p The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal. 
* %d print a decimal (base 10) number.
* %i print an integer in base 10.
* %u print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
* %x print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with lowercase.
* %X print a number in hexadecimal (base 16), with uppercase.
* %% print a percent sign.

In addition, since I used some of the functions from libft in that project, I copied its sources and its associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Because our projectâ€™s Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.
